# PROJECT_STATE.md — Current State Dashboard

Purpose: what's true RIGHT NOW. Not history (see Wiki/log.md), not
durable facts/decisions (see Wiki/*.md). Overwritten each session,
never appended to.

Read this first, every session. Then Wiki/index.md for anything this
file points to but doesn't explain.

## Last Updated
2026-08-10 — by /execute — BC-034 complete: Phase 8b, the final 5

## Active Blockers
- External: no roster client has a real, working Google Calendar or
  ecommerce connection to fully live-test Conversion Engine success
  paths (Calendly `status='error'`; WooCommerce test store
  non-functional). Now also true for the 2 new BC-034 roster clients
  (consultation, engagement) — same class of external limitation, not
  a workflow gap. Wiki/credentials/calendly.md, Wiki/credentials/woocommerce.md.
- 2 doc diffs owed by Commander (not applied by Claude Code, Section 13
  standing rule): `Database_Structure_v4_FINAL.md` missing an
  `appointments` section (now even more overdue — BC-034 found and fixed
  a real function bug in `create_client_schema_from_template` caused
  directly by this table being undocumented); `n8n_Workflow_Specification_v1.md`
  missing the SCH-007 row.
- ADP-001 (Voiceflow Adapter) documented as "Production" but no
  matching live n8n workflow found — doc/reality mismatch, not
  investigated.
- UTIL-002 (Data Validator) has no real caller anywhere — not urgent,
  no live risk.
- 4 open product/design decisions, none blocking current work directly
  — see Wiki/decisions/ (calendar-category-sharing,
  disconnect-provider-revocation, dashboard-auth-mapping,
  verification-tier-redesign).
- ADP-002's tool-forwarding allow-list (built BC-032) needs updating to
  include the 5 new WF-008–012 webhooks — not done this session (BC-034
  scope was the Tools themselves), flagged for the next Convocore-facing
  card.
