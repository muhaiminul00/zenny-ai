# PROJECT_STATE.md — Current State Dashboard

Purpose: what's true RIGHT NOW. Not history (see Wiki/log.md), not
durable facts/decisions (see Wiki/*.md). Overwritten each session,
never appended to.

Read this first, every session. Then Wiki/index.md for anything this
file points to but doesn't explain.

## Last Updated
2026-08-13 — by /execute — BC-050 complete: INT-007 (Stop Recovery) and
INT-008 (Resume Recovery) built, published, live-verified. Scoped correctly
via live investigation rather than the original assumption: INT-007's real
trigger (INT-009/010's per-email customer resolution) was genuinely
unblocked by Phase 10; INT-008's real trigger (`human_ownership_flag`
clearing) is NOT reply-based and has no writer anywhere in the built system
— confirmed by grep — so it was built + live-tested standalone, no caller
wired, per explicit human decision. INT-007 wired directly into INT-010
(fires on every inbound email, before categorization); a real end-to-end
run proved a reply gets both correctly categorized/drafted AND its
`recovery_queue` row genuinely stopped. New RPCs:
`stop_client_recovery_for_customer`, `resume_client_recovery`. Investigation
also surfaced a real pre-existing gap: no per-archetype max-recovery-step
count exists anywhere in the DB, and neither WF-018 nor INT-006 enforce the
"max steps reached → Stopped" condition — not fixed this card (out of
scope), flagged below. Full narrative: `Wiki/log.md`.

2026-08-13 (same day, prior) — by /execute — BC-049 complete: Email Manager's last two
Phase 10 gaps closed. Notion credential gate resolved by the human (real
root cause was the KB root page never being added to the "n8n"
integration's Connections list — BC-048's "stored secret mismatch"
diagnosis was wrong, corrected in the Wiki). Live-verified INT-012's full
Notion→Pinecone round trip for the first time (2 real KB pages fetched,
chunked, embedded, upserted). Built+published SCH-003 (hourly INT-009
fan-out) and SCH-004 (daily INT-012 fan-out per client with a KB source),
both live-verified against the real roster — SCH-004's first run 403'd on
a missing `SELECT` grant on `control.client_kb_source` (same
USAGE/GRANT-gap pattern as `platform-quirks/postgrest-schema-exposure.md`),
fixed live, re-verified working. Phase 10 (Email Manager) is now feature-
complete: all 7 workflows (WF-019, INT-009/010/011/012, SCH-003/004) live,
chained, and cadenced. Full narrative: `Wiki/log.md`.

2026-08-13 (same day, prior) — BC-048 complete: Email Manager chain made
genuinely live-wired end to end (INT-009→010→011 fan-out), Pinecone
credential type fixed, real BC-045 categorization bug found+fixed. Full
narrative: `Wiki/log.md`.

2026-08-13 (same day, prior) — BC-047 complete: INT-011 Draft Email +
INT-012 Sync Notion KB built, published. KB source pivoted from Convocore
(billing gate) to Notion+Pinecone. Full narrative: `Wiki/log.md`.

Older entries (BC-045, BC-044, BC-043 and earlier): see `Wiki/log.md`.

## Current Phase
Phase 8 — Conversion Engine (11 Tools) — COMPLETE (11/11 built and
live-tested)
Phase 9 — Recovery Engine — IN PROGRESS (WF-018 SendRecoveryMessage +
INT-006/SCH-001 Process Recovery Queue + INT-007 StopRecovery + INT-008
ResumeRecovery all built, published, live-verified; cadence fires
automatically, email channel only per explicit scope cut; INT-007 is
genuinely wired live into INT-010's per-email chain; INT-008 is built and
proven but has no real caller yet — its actual trigger,
`human_ownership_flag` clearing, is written nowhere in the built system,
see Active Blockers)
Phase 10 — Email Manager — FEATURE-COMPLETE (WF-019, INT-009, INT-010,
INT-011, INT-012, SCH-003, SCH-004 all built/published/live-verified,
BC-043 through BC-049. KB source is Notion+Pinecone, not Convocore
(dormant). Full chain live: INT-009→010→011 genuinely chained, INT-012's
Notion→Pinecone round trip live-verified, both cadences (SCH-003 hourly
inbox, SCH-004 daily KB sync) live and dispatching for real. No open
Credential Gate.)

## Active Blockers
- **INT-008 (Resume Recovery) has no caller:** built and live-tested
  (BC-050) but its real trigger — `human_ownership_flag` flipping back to
  `false` when a human closes their task without the customer replying —
  is written nowhere in the built system (confirmed by grep). No dashboard
  action or workflow currently clears this flag. Needs its own future
  Build Card once the ownership-release mechanism itself is scoped (likely
  a dashboard action on an escalation/`active_issues` row); not urgent,
  Recovery Engine functions correctly without it (WF-018 still won't send
  to a human-owned lead, per the existing gate — leads just stay Paused
  indefinitely instead of auto-resuming).
- **Recovery cadence's "max steps reached → Stopped" condition is not
  enforced anywhere real:** discovered during BC-050. No per-archetype
  max-step count exists in the DB (`leads.recovery_profile` is free text),
  and neither WF-018 nor INT-006/SCH-001 check current_step against any
  max. INT-008 reproduces `Recovery_Engine_Flow.md` §3's documented step
  counts as a local hardcoded map for its own use, but that doesn't fix
  the sweep — a lead could theoretically keep receiving recovery sends
  past its archetype's documented max step count. Not fixed this card
  (out of BC-050's scope); worth a small future Build Card (add the same
  max-step check to `get_due_recovery_queue` or WF-018 itself).
- **External, Convocore-KB path blocked:** Convocore's REST API now
  returns 403 "requires Business plan or higher" workspace-wide (`Zenny-
  UI` workspace, same secret/agent that worked live on 2026-08-02/04) —
  confirmed independent of MCP. `control.convocore_agent_map` stays in
  place, dormant. Not investigated further — human's call whether to
  upgrade the Convocore plan or stay on Notion+Pinecone permanently.
- External: no roster client has a real, working Google Calendar or
  ecommerce connection to fully live-test Conversion Engine success
  paths (Calendly `status='error'`; WooCommerce test store
  non-functional). Now also true for the 2 new BC-034 roster clients
  (consultation, engagement) — same class of external limitation, not
  a workflow gap. Wiki/credentials/calendly.md, Wiki/credentials/woocommerce.md.
- **DEFERRED (to-do, not blocking):** `Database_Structure_v4_FINAL.md`
  missing an `appointments` section — real deployed table (BC-013),
  used by 5 of 11 Conversion Engine Tools, still undocumented. Not
  blocking (BC-034 already found and fixed the one real bug this gap
  caused, in `create_client_schema_from_template`), but the doc debt
  itself is still open — owed by Commander, not applied by Claude Code
  per Section 13's standing rule. Deferred rather than scheduled;
  revisit next time this doc is touched for any other reason, or
  proactively if it starts causing a second incident.
- Doc diff owed by Commander: `n8n_Workflow_Specification_v1.md`
  missing the SCH-007 row.
- ADP-001 (Voiceflow Adapter) documented as "Production" but no
  matching live n8n workflow found — doc/reality mismatch, not
  investigated.
- UTIL-002 (Data Validator) has no real caller anywhere — not urgent,
  no live risk.
- 4 open product/design decisions, none blocking current work directly
  — see Wiki/decisions/ (calendar-category-sharing,
  disconnect-provider-revocation, dashboard-auth-mapping,
  verification-tier-redesign).

## Next Build Card
BC-039/043/044/045 (Phase 9/10 build history through 2026-08-12): see
`Wiki/log.md` — reply-trigger split, WF-019, INT-009, INT-010.

**BC-048 complete (2026-08-13): Email Manager chain genuinely live-wired.**
INT-009 → INT-010 → INT-011 now fan out for real; fixed the Pinecone
credential-type mismatch; found and fixed a real pre-existing BC-045
categorization bug. See `Wiki/log.md`.

**BC-049 complete (2026-08-13): Notion credential gate closed (human
fixed page-sharing, not a secret), SCH-003 + SCH-004 built, published,
live-verified.** Phase 10 (Email Manager) is now feature-complete — all
7 workflows live, chained, cadenced.

**BC-050 complete (2026-08-13): INT-007 (Stop Recovery) + INT-008
(Resume Recovery) built, published, live-verified.** INT-007 genuinely
wired into INT-010's live chain. INT-008 built standalone, no caller yet
(real blocker, see Active Blockers). Per the bounded auto-handoff rule,
the loop stops here (this card wrote to live n8n/Supabase state) for a
human pulse-check before starting a new phase.

No Build Card currently issued and un-actioned. Candidates for the next
session: Phase 5A (Inventory dashboard) / 5D (Onboarding dashboard),
SCH-007, ADP-001 doc/reality investigation, the new max-steps-enforcement
gap, or scoping INT-008's ownership-release caller. (`appointments` doc
diff intentionally NOT in this list — see Active Blockers, deferred.)

## Handoff Note (for next session)

**Where things stand:** Phase 8 (Conversion Engine, all 11 Tools) done.
Phase 9 (Recovery Engine) has all 4 internal workflows + SCH-001 live
(WF-018, INT-006, INT-007, INT-008); INT-007 is genuinely wired into
Email Manager's live chain, INT-008 is proven but has no caller (see
Active Blockers). Phase 10 (Email Manager) is feature-complete: all 7
workflows live (WF-019, INT-009/010/011/012, SCH-003/004), fully chained
and cadenced, no open Credential Gate. KB source is Notion+Pinecone;
Convocore stays wired-dormant. Nothing is mid-flight; the next session
starts clean. Full narrative: `Wiki/log.md` (search by BC number).

**What's genuinely open, in priority order:**
1. No roster client (old or new) has a real connected calendar/
   ecommerce store. (Email/Gmail is the one exception, Client A only.)
2. `appointments` doc diff — deferred, see Active Blockers.
3. INT-008's ownership-release caller, and the recovery max-steps
   enforcement gap — both newly surfaced by BC-050, see Active Blockers.
4. Everything else is a genuine next-phase choice — see Next Build Card
   candidates above.

Nothing requires human acknowledgment before proceeding — all
self-resolved document-level items from recent sessions are logged in
Wiki/log.md and their relevant Wiki/platform-quirks/ pages.
