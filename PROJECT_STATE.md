# PROJECT_STATE.md — Live Build State

```
Purpose:   Real, current ground truth of what's actually built, tested,
           and blocked — updated by Claude Code at the end of every
           session. This is NOT a plan (that's Planning_to_Build_
           Transition_v1.md) — it's a status snapshot. The Commander
           reads this before issuing every new Build Card.
Rule:      Overwrite the status sections below each session. NEVER
           delete the Session Log — it's append-only, oldest at bottom.
Location:  Project root. Committed to git (zenny-sync) after every
           Claude Code session, alongside whatever code/schema changed.

## Last Updated
2026-08-05 — by Claude Code, Session 14 (BC-013 — Phase 5 data layer built, 1 new self-resolved item)

## Current Phase
Phase 5 (Dashboard Data Layer) — schema built: `orders` (public +
tpl_commerce) and `appointments` (public, tpl_appointment, tpl_commerce,
tpl_emergency, tpl_consultation — see this session's self-resolved item
below for why 3 of those 5 weren't in the original card). Parallel-write
Change Request applied to all 5 affected Tool entries in
n8n_Workflow_Specification_v1.md Part 13. Data-flow doc written
(`06_Infrastructure/Database/Phase5_Dashboard_Data_Flow.md`). BC-012's
prior gate was implicitly acknowledged by the Commander issuing BC-013
directly (Phase 5 schema work) — noted, not assumed silently. Per the
new rule's gate, this session stops again: 1 new self-resolved item
occurred (see Blockers), awaiting Commander acknowledgment before Phase
5 UI work (the next card) begins. No dashboard UI built — schema +
data-flow doc only, per this card's explicit scope. Convocore Adapter
(ADP-002) — **COMPLETE.** BC-010 closed the one item BC-009 left open:
human-handoff's staged-fallback Stage 2 trigger, built per the
Commander's exact operational definition. ADP-002 registered in
n8n_Workflow_Specification_v1.md Part 17 (BC-009 — also closed the gap
that ADP-001/Voiceflow was never registered either). All 3 stale
"Prospective" lines updated to real status (BC-009). Phases 1-3
remain COMPLETE, unchanged. Phase 5 (4 New Dashboard Systems) is next.

## Phase 5 Discovery Findings (BC-012 — discovery only, no build)

Per Planning_to_Build_Transition_v1.md Part 4 Phase 5, 4 Directus-based
dashboards, each with its own database:

```
5A. Inventory Dashboard — for clients WITHOUT Shopify/WooCommerce.
    Client updates stock -> workflow syncs into that client's Convocore
    KB. Agent's product lookup always hits Convocore KB, never our DB
    directly. Not yet built; the underlying sync workflow (Shopify/
    WooCommerce -> Convocore KB) is also not yet built (Findings doc
    Part 3.3 / carried forward from BC-005/BC-009 as a known future
    SCH-{NNN} item).
5B. Order Lookup Dashboard — EVERY order lands here first, regardless
    of provider. Human approve/reject gate BEFORE any real-store push.
5C. Appointment Booking Dashboard — PARALLEL-WRITE pattern (client
    calendar + our DB simultaneously, not sequential), READS
    client-calendar-first/our-DB-fallback (the opposite direction from
    writes). Confirmed a genuine architecture change from the original
    per-Tool spec. **Live-checked this session: the Change Request
    against n8n_Workflow_Specification_v1.md's CreateAppointment/
    CreateReservation/CreateInspectionSlotBooking/CreateScoredBooking/
    CheckAvailability entries has NOT yet been applied** — grepped the
    live document, zero mentions of "parallel-write" anywhere in it.
    Those 5 Tools' Part 13 entries still describe single-destination
    writes. This CR needs applying before or during the real 5C Build
    Card — flagged as a known prerequisite, not applied in this
    discovery-only card.
5D. Onboarding Form Dashboard — direct client-facing form writing
    straight into control.clients/control.client_config, replacing
    manual onboarding entry. This is the dashboard-facing front end for
    Client_Onboarding_Sequence_Spec.md's 8-step backend provisioning
    process (see below) — the form doesn't replace that sequence, it
    needs to trigger/kick it off.
```

**The data layer underneath (Client_Onboarding_Sequence_Spec.md,
already spec'd AND end-to-end tested against one throwaway client,
client_test_001_acme_emergency_test, still live in zenny-vault):**
8 steps — determine archetype (human/sales) -> copy template schema
(`create_client_schema_from_template`, already built & tested) ->
register exposed schemas -> insert control.clients/client_config rows
-> initial sync (client_config/templates/email_categories/
recovery_cadence_profiles, with real default-vs-override merge logic
for the last one) -> apply/verify RLS -> Data API exposure re-check ->
connect n8n workflows (documented handoff, not built by this spec).

**Real, confirmed gap directly relevant to 5D:** Step 3 (Register
Exposed Schemas) has **no SQL/MCP-level mechanism at all** in this
managed Supabase project — confirmed empirically during the spec's own
end-to-end test (checked `pg_roles`/`pg_catalog` for a `pgrst.
db_schemas` GUC, none exists; no available Supabase MCP tool manages
this). Must be done via the Supabase Dashboard manually, OR automated
later via the Supabase Management API from within an n8n workflow using
a project-admin-scoped service account. **If 5D's Onboarding Form is
meant to fully automate client provisioning end-to-end, this is an
unresolved implementation question the real Phase 5 Build Card needs to
decide** (manual step remains human-in-the-loop even with an automated
form vs. build the Management-API n8n workflow) — not decided anywhere
in the source docs, flagged here rather than assumed.

**Template_Migration_Process.md — explicitly NOT dashboard scope.**
Deliberately MANUAL-only procedure (no scheduled job/UI/automation, by
architect decision) for when `public`'s reference structure changes
later and needs retrofitting into existing client schemas. Confirmed:
none of the 4 Phase 5 dashboards need to expose UI for this — it stays
a human-run SQL procedure, reusing `control.sync_log`'s existing shape
for logging (no new table).

**Open, not decided anywhere:** Directus itself has still never been
live-verified as the current/fit tool — Planning doc Part 6 item 7
flags this as "Phase 5 task, first action, Claude Code's call to
confirm or swap." Not done in this discovery-only card; will be the
real Phase 5 Build Card's first action.

**No other explicit DECISION NEEDED flags found specific to Phase 5**
in any of the 5 documents read this session, beyond the two items above
(Step 3's automation approach, Directus verification).

                                  the conversation. The Adapter-buildable,
                                  non-timer signal is: "Check Existing

## Credentials — Real Current State

```
Google:     SEEDED, real. client_id = real Google Cloud OAuth client ID
            (matches Zenny_production_credential(...).txt exactly, an
            *.apps.googleusercontent.com identifier — client IDs are not
            secrets per Google's own model, unlike client_secret),
            client_secret_id -> Vault UUID cc67675c-3813-48b3-9e13-
            c22e18e00da9. app_status still 'testing' (per prior session —
            verification submitted, pending Google's review).
Shopify:    SEEDED, real. client_id = real Shopify Dev Client ID,
            client_secret_id -> Vault UUID 02957b66-82f0-49d1-898d-
            de532d8bc4ab. app_status 'testing'.
Slack:      SEEDED, real, WITH A CONFIRMED (not just flagged) SCHEMA
            MISMATCH — BC-004 Step C confirmed: captured bot token is
            NOT a substitute for a real Slack OAuth app in this
            multi-tenant model (Part 8.4 assumes a shared "Add to Slack"
            app). Row left EXACTLY as committed in BC-003, no change
            this session — client_id = literal
            'SLACK_BOT_TOKEN_MODE_NO_OAUTH_APP', client_secret_id ->
            Vault UUID 8e8c4638-85b0-40e4-b02b-a69798b3acfb (real bot
            token). Confirmed NON-BLOCKING for Phase 1 closure — logged
            as a follow-up (see Blockers) for whenever Slack notification
            is actually built (Phase 3/UTIL-004 or later).
Calendly:   SEEDED, real, FULLY WIRED (BC-004 Step D). client_id = real
            Calendly OAuth Client ID, client_secret_id -> Vault UUID
            6060ef36-e48a-44dc-bb87-c9564afbd7be. app_status 'testing'.
            Webhook signing key now has a real schema home: migration
            024_add_webhook_signing_key_id_to_oauth_apps.sql added
            oauth_apps.webhook_signing_key_id (uuid, nullable, same
            non-FK Vault-reference pattern as client_secret_id) and the
            row was updated to reference Vault UUID 44e988d4-403b-48ce-
            b15e-5c7f9edfefd0 — confirmed via RETURNING. get_advisors
            (security) run after: no new issue introduced, only the
            pre-existing documented "RLS enabled, no policies" posture
            (Database_Structure_v4_FINAL.md §9, service_role bypasses
            RLS by design). **Doc diff still owed by Commander:**
            Client_Integration_and_Credential_Platform_v1.md Part 4.2's
            oauth_apps schema block needs webhook_signing_key_id added
            to its column list — Claude Code does not edit that document.
Cal.com:    RESOLVED (BC-004 Step B). Corrected understanding from BC-003:
            'pending' was always the deliberate, confirmed decision
            (Planning_to_Build_Transition_v1.md Part 2.9 / Part 6 item 2)
            — the live chk_oauth_apps_status CHECK constraint was the
            stale artifact, never updated to match that decision, not
            the other way around. Migration
            023_add_pending_to_oauth_apps_status.sql applied (additive
            only — dropped and re-added the constraint with 'pending'
            appended, no existing valid value removed; exact prior
            definition verified live via pg_get_constraintdef before
            writing the ALTER). app_status now 'pending', confirmed via
            RETURNING. client_id left as 'PENDING_CALCOM_CLIENT_ID'
            placeholder — correct, no real Cal.com credential exists yet
            (business email still pending). get_advisors run after: same
            result as Calendly above, nothing new. **Doc diff still owed
            by Commander:** Client_Integration_and_Credential_Platform_
            v1.md Part 4.2's app_status column comment needs 'pending'
            added to its documented value list.
WooCommerce: row exists, app_status = 'not_applicable', matches Part 8.3
            fallback pattern (no OAuth registration needed) — CONFIRMED
            correct as-is, nothing to seed, nothing changed.
control.oauth_apps seeded:        4 of 6 providers now hold real
                                   Vault-backed credentials (Google,
                                   Shopify, Slack, Calendly — Slack
                                   flagged above). Cal.com blocked on a
                                   real constraint mismatch. WooCommerce
                                   correctly needs nothing. The 4 old
                                   placeholder Vault secrets (google/
                                   shopify/slack/calendly) are now
                                   orphaned/unreferenced but NOT deleted —
                                   a cleanup DELETE was attempted and
                                   blocked by the harness's own
                                   permission classifier, not worked
                                   around. Harmless (unreferenced), just
                                   untidy — safe to leave or clean up
                                   later.

## MCP Configuration — Real Current State (BC-002)

```
Supabase MCP:  CONFIGURED, LIVE-VERIFIED. list_projects returned 2 real
               projects — "zenny-vault" (id kmhzosyljpzheqvfuyzm,
               ap-northeast-2, ACTIVE_HEALTHY, the documented/correct
               project) and "zenny-dashboard" (id bzckrqgasqiglsgqyzft,
               ap-south-1, ACTIVE_HEALTHY — undocumented second project,
               likely the teammate's earlier standalone reference build;
               not investigated further, flagged below). Followed up
               with list_tables(project_id=kmhzosyljpzheqvfuyzm,
               schemas=[control]) — returned all 9 documented control
               tables correctly, PLUS 4 tables PROJECT_STATE.md had
               marked "NOT YET BUILT": control.oauth_apps (6 rows),
               control.client_connections (0), control.oauth_state (0),
               control.connection_audit_log (0). See correction below.
n8n MCP:       CONFIGURED, LIVE-VERIFIED. search_workflows (no filter)
               returned 38 real workflows, including several already

               CREATION ENGINE, WF-002 CONVERSION ENGINE, WF-003
               ESCALATION ENGINE, WF-501 Error Logger, WF-503 Data
               Validator, the 6 WF-2xx Email Manager v1 drafts, and 4
               "Zenny Credential Platform" workflows including UTIL-006
               Credential Resolver and SCH-006 Token Refresh Sweep —
               consistent with this file's existing "BUILT" entries
               below). n8n instance/workflow inventory is real and
               substantially ahead of what a from-scratch Phase 0 would
               assume.
```

**CORRECTION to this file's prior "Database — Real Current State" section
(above), discovered only as a byproduct of BC-002's live-verification
call, not investigated further — that's BC-003 scope:** `control.
oauth_apps`, `control.client_connections`, `control.oauth_state`, and
`control.connection_audit_log` already exist in zenny-vault (previously
marked "NOT YET BUILT" above, now corrected to "EXISTS" pending BC-003's
proper inspection of row contents/schema-shape correctness). Do not trust
the un-struck lines above as current until BC-003 re-verifies each one
directly.

  Booking, CreateScoredBooking) belong to conversions_restaurant/
  conversions_emergency/conversions_consultation — none of which live in
  tpl_appointment. Step 2's literal scope and Step 3's literal scope did
  not line up with each other.
- **Documents/evidence checked:** Planning_to_Build_Transition_v1.md
  Part 4 Phase 5C (the original source of the "5 Tools" list BC-013
  Step 3 itself cites); live confirmation that the `appointments`
  table's FK was already written generically (references the schema's
  own `conversions` table via a parameterized migration, never
  hardcoded to `conversions_appointment` specifically) — meaning
  extending deployment required no schema redesign, only running the
  same already-correct pattern against 3 more schemas.
- **Resolved to:** deployed `appointments` (identical 9-column shape) to
  `tpl_commerce`, `tpl_emergency`, and `tpl_consultation` as well —
  confirmed live via `information_schema.columns` across all 5 schemas
  now. Updated all 5 Tool entries' Workflow Spec sections consistently
  (no entry left with a "not yet deployed" caveat the other 4 don't
  have).
- **Why:** per the new rule's item 3 (mechanical/structural decision
  with an obviously correct answer given the rest of the architecture),
  this is squarely resolvable directly — the table shape doesn't change,
  only which schemas already-decided architecture (Planning doc's own
  Phase 5C list) says need it. Leaving 3 of 5 explicitly-named Tools
  with a disclosed-but-unresolved gap, in the very same card that
  updated all 5 Tools' contracts, would have been an internally
  inconsistent deliverable.
- Migrations 035/036 applied and committed already — the schema work
  itself is not blocked on acknowledgment, only PROCEEDING TO PHASE 5
  UI WORK is.

Per the new rule: this session stops here. Do not begin Phase 5 UI work
(the next card) or any other build work until the Commander has
explicitly acknowledged this specific resolution in a follow-up
message.

### Self-resolved document-level item (BC-012 Step 0) — RESOLVED,
ACKNOWLEDGED (Commander issued BC-013 directly, Phase 5 schema work,
implicitly confirming this resolution — noted, not silently assumed)
- **What:** BC-012's card instructed archiving Convocore_Agent_Build_
  Order_Guide_v1.md into root's `_archive_planning_phase/` (Phase 0's
  general-purpose archive). Live investigation found the file had
  already been moved (by the human, outside git) to
  `05_Platform_Builds/Convocore/Archieve/` instead — a folder already
  holding 4 other superseded Convocore-family docs (Convocore_Adapter_
  Spec_v1.md, Convocore_Canvas_Ground_Truth_v1.md, Convocore_Findings_
  Required_Updates_v1.md, Convocore_Master_Reference_v1.md, plus 2
  others) — a well-established, consistent local convention for this
  exact document family.
- **Documents/evidence checked:** live `ls` of both candidate archive
  locations; confirmed via diff that the file's content is byte-
  identical at the new location (pure move, no edits); confirmed v2's
  own Status line ("Supersedes Convocore_Agent_Build_Order_Guide_v1.md")
  as the supersession authority.
- **Resolved to:** kept the file at `05_Platform_Builds/Convocore/
  Archieve/` (formalized the human's already-made move via `git add -A`,
  which correctly registered it as a rename) rather than moving it a
  second time to match the card's more generic instruction.
- **Why:** per the new rule's precedence logic, a more specific,
  already-consistent local pattern (4+ sibling files) wins over a more
  generic instruction referencing a different, less-specific precedent
  (Phase 0's general archive). The human's own already-taken action is
  additional evidence pointing the same direction, not just the
  existing file pattern alone.
- Committed and pushed already (ed0cc5f) — the file move itself is not
  blocked on acknowledgment, only PROCEEDING TO PHASE 5 is.

Per the new rule: this session stops here. Do not begin Phase 5 or any
other build work until the Commander has explicitly acknowledged this
specific resolution in a follow-up message.

(Also confirmed, not a self-resolved item — just an investigation
finding: Convocore_Adapter_Spec_FINAL.md's earlier BC-011-noted
modification was a human commit (63686eb) that landed between BC-011
and BC-012, a 1-line routing-table pointer update from v1 to v2 of the
Build Order Guide. Already committed by the human; nothing for Claude
Code to resolve or flag.)

NONE blocking Phase 4 closure. Phase 4 is COMPLETE as of BC-010.

Resolved this session (BC-010), no longer open:
- human-handoff's staged-fallback trigger condition — built per the
  Commander's exact operational definition, confirmed live (20 nodes).

Doc diff flagged for Commander to apply (BC-010 Step 2, not applied by
Claude Code — Section 13's standing rule, same pattern as BC-006/BC-009):
- Agent_Runtime_System_v1.md's "##### D. Human Handoff Handler" section
  needs a new subsection documenting the Stage 2 staged-fallback
  addition (Commander's BC-010 decision + the Adapter-level mechanism
  actually used to detect it — see PROJECT_STATE.md's ADP-002 entry
  above for the exact mechanism, or n8n workflow BOxeuH6ehv46FZL0
  directly). Exact insertion point: after the existing "What context is
  passed to human agent" paragraph (line ~3370) and before "Escalation
  Priority Classification" — a natural place for a "Staged Fallback
  (Stage 2)" subsection. Suggested content: the Commander's exact
  3-condition definition from this card, the "silence is not a negative
  signal" clarification, and a pointer to ADP-002 as the implementing
  mechanism (Runtime docs describe behavior, not n8n wiring — full
  technical detail belongs in the Adapter Spec / PROJECT_STATE.md, not
  duplicated here).

Open, non-blocking follow-up (BC-009):
- ADP-002 has never been tested against real Convocore traffic — no live
  agent exists yet (separate, paused lane per human's own instruction),
  and control.convocore_agent_map still has 0 rows (BC-005). Structural
  verification only. Real end-to-end testing is a future item once a
  real agent + convocore_agent_map row exist.
- Known, disclosed implementation deviation: the card asked for "UTIL-006
  Credential Resolver... per its existing contract" to fetch the agent's
  secret. UTIL-006's REAL contract (client_connections-scoped) has no
  path to convocore_agent_map's secret — used the same underlying
  read_credential_secret RPC directly instead of literally invoking
  UTIL-006 as a sub-workflow. Functionally equivalent (same Vault
  mechanism, same security guarantee), architecturally not identical to
  the literal instruction — flagged for Commander awareness, not hidden.
- SCH-{NNN} Shopify/WooCommerce -> Convocore KB sync workflow (Findings
  doc Part 3.3) — confirmed real, not yet designed or built. Explicitly
  out of BC-009's scope; logging its existence per the card's own
  instruction so it isn't lost before Phase 11 (Scheduled Workflows).

NONE blocking Phase 3 closure. Phase 3 is COMPLETE as of BC-008.

Open, non-blocking follow-up (BC-008):
- UTIL-004's Slack branch cannot send until a real Slack credential
  exists — same underlying gap as BC-004 Step C's Slack OAuth app item,
  now also blocking UTIL-004 specifically, not just future Slack
  notification generally. Confirmed live: zero Slack credentials of any
  kind exist in n8n right now. Email branch is fully functional.
- Found 2 legacy n8n workflows from an old, pre-current-architecture
  numbering scheme: "WF-501 — Error Logger" (id bc6dTzeicmbt3k6l) and
  "WF-503 — Data Validator" (id uYA7ONZa2R6QOR8V), both inactive, 0
  triggers, created 2026-06-12 (predates this project's current
  n8n_Workflow_Specification_v1.md UTIL-{NNN} convention entirely).
  NOT MCP-accessible (availableInMCP: false) — could not inspect their
  actual node contents, and no MCP tool exists to toggle that flag
  remotely. Not touched, not deleted, not adopted/renamed. Flagged for
  Commander review: likely safe to archive/delete as legacy duplicates
  of UTIL-002/UTIL-003 (now genuinely built under the correct
  convention), but that's a human call given Claude Code couldn't
  verify their contents.
- Workflow Spec registration diff (per BC-008 Step 6, Section 13's
  standing rule — Claude Code flags, Commander applies): n8n_Workflow_
  Specification_v1.md Part 6.10's Utility ID Summary currently lists
  only names/IDs, no build-status column. Suggested addition (exact
  diff, Commander's call on placement/format):
    UTIL-001 Schema Resolver         — Built, BC-008 (n8n: qbhdmH2ZN6opkXL1)
    UTIL-002 Data Validator          — Built, BC-008 (n8n: Cw1LW6ZXHaJkrJLB)
    UTIL-003 Error Logger            — Built, BC-008 (n8n: Azi7BaBldiK3NDqk)
    UTIL-004 Notification Router     — Built, BC-008, PARTIAL (email works;
                                        Slack blocked, see above)
                                        (n8n: fcilrbwldjnn92Yn)
    UTIL-005 Stop Checker            — Built, BC-008 (n8n: IWuuNyRjp7vPjNui)
    UTIL-006 Credential Resolver     — Built, prior session (n8n: LzP5m25iMmhROVsD)

NONE blocking Phase 2 closure. Phase 2 is COMPLETE as of BC-007.

NONE blocking Phase 1 closure. Phase 1 remains COMPLETE as of BC-004.

Resolved this session (BC-007), no longer open:
- escalations.escalation_team — added (migration 032), Commander-
  approved, confirmed live in public + all 5 tpl_* schemas.

Open, non-blocking follow-up (BC-004 Step C):
- Slack needs a real OAuth app (client_id+secret, chat:write scope only
  per External_Integration_Strategy_v1.md Part 6.2) registered before
  multi-tenant Slack notification is viable — the bot token captured is
  a single-workspace credential, wired into oauth_apps as an honest
  placeholder (client_id='SLACK_BOT_TOKEN_MODE_NO_OAUTH_APP'), not a
  real multi-tenant credential. Not blocking Phase 1 closure; blocks
  whenever Slack notification is actually built (Phase 3/UTIL-004 or
  later).

Standing discipline note (not a blocker, carried forward):
- Two Supabase projects exist under this org (zenny-vault AND an
  undocumented zenny-dashboard, per an earlier reference build) — every
  future MCP call in this project MUST explicitly target project_id
  kmhzosyljpzheqvfuyzm (zenny-vault). Human confirmed directly (BC-004
  context) that zenny-vault is canonical and zenny-dashboard belongs to
  a different, earlier build — not re-investigating further. Every
  BC-002/BC-003/BC-004 query targeted zenny-vault explicitly.

Resolved this session (BC-004), no longer open:
- Cal.com's app_status constraint — migrated (023), set to 'pending'.
- Calendly's webhook signing key — real column added (024), wired.
- auth.users — confirmed live at 0 rows.
- 4 orphaned placeholder Vault secrets — confirmed live at 0 remaining.

2 doc-diffs still owed by the Commander (not Claude Code's job per this
card's own instruction — flagged, not applied):
- Client_Integration_and_Credential_Platform_v1.md Part 4.2's app_status
  column comment: add 'pending' to the documented value list.
- Same document, same Part, oauth_apps schema block: add
  webhook_signing_key_id to the column list.
```

## Deviations From Build Card / Open Questions for Commander

```
1. No .gitignore existed at repo root — .mcp.json (plaintext
   WORKSPACE_SECRET), its docker-backup copy, and a credential .txt file
   were all unprotected from an accidental `git add .` commit. Added a
   .gitignore covering these plus common OS cruft. Flagging since this
   is a real security gap that predates this session, not something the
   Transition doc anticipated needing a fix.
2. `.claude/skills/supabase` and `.claude/skills/supabase-postgres-best-
   practices` were dangling symlinks pointing at the pre-rename project
   path (`/e/Programming/Zeny Ai - Voiceflow/...`) — the folder was
   renamed to `Zenny - breakthrough` at some point and the symlinks were
   never updated, so these skills were silently not loading. Repointed
   both symlinks to the correct current path (same target content,
   `.agents/skills/*`, untouched). Purely a path fix, no content change.
3. "Database Architecture Review & Future Runtime Roadmap v1.md" (root,
   dated 2026-07-18) was NOT archived — genuinely unsure whether its
   "Future Runtime Roadmap" content is still live or fully superseded by
   Database_Structure_v4_FINAL.md + the Convocore FINAL docs. Flagging
   per your instruction to leave-and-flag rather than guess.
4. "AI_Workforce_Implementation_Operating_Manual_v2.md" was archived
   alongside AI_Builder_Operating_Manual_v1.md even though Claude_Build_
   Command_Protocol_v2.md's Status line only names the latter as
   superseded. Its content describes the old three-party Claude Code +
   Codex model, which Protocol v2 explicitly retires ("Codex is no
   longer part of this pipeline") — judged clearly superseded by
   content, not just by an exact filename match. Flagging the reasoning
   since it wasn't a literal 1:1 per the stated rule.
5. "Zenny_production_credential(claude_code_can_use).txt" was left in
   place, untouched, not evaluated for content — file organization scope
   was documents, not credential material, and this file is exactly the
   kind of thing this session should surface rather than silently move
   or open. Now covered by .gitignore going forward regardless.

## Session Log (append-only — newest at top, never delete old entries)

### Session 14 — 2026-08-05 — BC-013: Phase 5 data layer (1 new self-resolved item)
- What was done: Step 0 — live audit confirmed no drift in conversions_
  ecom/conversions_restaurant/conversions_appointment across public +
  relevant tpl_* schemas, and confirmed no orders/appointments table
  existed anywhere. Step 1 — built order_status_enum + public.orders +
  tpl_commerce.orders (migration 033), with a UNIQUE(conversion_id)
  constraint added beyond the card's literal spec (one review-row per
  conversion) and no client_id column (verified live that no other
  client-schema common table carries one). Step 2 — built calendar_
  write_status_enum + authoritative_source_enum + public.appointments +
  tpl_appointment.appointments (migration 034), with a
  client_calendar_provider column added beyond the card's literal spec
  (audit-trail value beyond client_config's current-value-only field),
  flagged not silently added. Mid-Step-2/3, found and self-resolved a
  real internal inconsistency in the card itself (full log in Blockers
  above) — extended appointments to tpl_commerce (migration 035),
  tpl_emergency and tpl_consultation (migration 036). Step 3 — applied
  the parallel-write Change Request to all 5 Tool entries in n8n_
  Workflow_Specification_v1.md Part 13 (CheckAvailability's read-
  direction note, CreateAppointment/CreateReservation/
  CreateInspectionSlotBooking/CreateScoredBooking's write-direction
  contracts), all 5 consistently deployed, none left with a disclosed
  gap. Step 4 — wrote 06_Infrastructure/Database/Phase5_Dashboard_Data_
  Flow.md, genuinely short, table-based, cross-referencing rather than
  duplicating existing docs.
- What was verified live vs. assumed: Every table's real saved column
  set confirmed via information_schema.columns across all schemas after
  each migration, not assumed from the migration SQL succeeding. get_
  advisors run after all schema changes — only the pre-existing,
  deliberate RLS-no-policy posture, nothing new introduced.
- What broke / changed from plan: BC-012's prior gate was implicitly
  acknowledged by the Commander issuing this card directly (Phase 5
  schema work) — noted explicitly rather than silently assumed. This
  session's own new self-resolved item (appointments' schema-coverage
  gap) triggers the same gate again — a real, working instance of the
  new rule catching a genuine internal inconsistency the card itself
  contained, not a hypothetical.
- Files touched: n8n_Workflow_Specification_v1.md (5 Tool entries in
  Part 13), 06_Infrastructure/Database/Phase5_Dashboard_Data_Flow.md
  (new), PROJECT_STATE.md. Database: 4 new migrations (033-036) applied
  to zenny-vault, 2 new tables (orders, appointments) across 7 schema
  locations total.
- **This session: 1 self-resolved document-level item, logged per the
  standing rule. Awaiting explicit Commander acknowledgment before
  Phase 5 UI work or any other build work begins.**

### Session 13 — 2026-08-05 — BC-012: cleanup + Phase 5 discovery (1 self-resolved item, new authority)
- What was done: Step 0 — live-checked git status of both files BC-011
  had flagged. Convocore_Adapter_Spec_FINAL.md was already fully
  resolved by a human commit (63686eb) between sessions — confirmed via
  `git diff --stat` (clean) and `git show 63686eb` (a 1-line routing-
  pointer update, v1->v2 of the Build Order Guide). Convocore_Agent_
  Build_Order_Guide_v1.md's archive location was a genuine self-
  resolved item under the new Document Resolution Authority — see the
  full logged entry in Blockers above. Formalized the move via
  `git add -A` (git correctly detected it as a rename) and committed/
  pushed (ed0cc5f) before continuing. Step 1 — read all 5 required Phase
  5 documents in full (Client_Onboarding_Sequence_Spec.md, Template_
  Migration_Process.md, Client_Onboarding_Guide.md, plus re-confirmed
  Database_Structure_v4_FINAL.md §1-2/§8.5 and Planning doc Part 4 Phase
  5 from required reading already in context). Step 2 — compiled the
  full Phase 5 discovery findings section above, including a live check
  (grep) confirming 5C's parallel-write Change Request has NOT yet been
  applied to n8n_Workflow_Specification_v1.md.
- What was verified live vs. assumed: The archive-location resolution
  was based on a real `ls` of both candidate folders (not memory) plus
  a byte-identical diff confirming a pure move. The Adapter Spec
  resolution was based on real `git diff`/`git show` output, not
  assumed clean. The parallel-write CR status was a real grep against
  the live document, not carried forward from earlier session context.
- What broke / changed from plan: This is the first session where the
  new Document Resolution Authority's gate genuinely fired (BC-011
  itself had zero self-resolved items, since it performed no build
  work). Per the rule: stopping here, not proceeding into any Phase 5
  build work, until the Commander acknowledges the archive-location
  resolution specifically.
- Files touched: Convocore_Agent_Build_Order_Guide_v1.md (moved, no
  content change), PROJECT_STATE.md. No n8n or Supabase changes this
  session (discovery only, per the card's own Step 2 scope).
- **This session: 1 self-resolved document-level item, logged per the
  new standing rule. Awaiting explicit Commander acknowledgment before
  Phase 5 or any other build work begins.**

### Session 12 — 2026-08-05 — BC-011: Document Resolution Authority (standing rule change, no build work)
- What was done: Read Convocore_Agent_Build_Order_Guide_v2.md in full,
  including Part 0.1's Doc-Search-First Rule (the precedent this card's
  new authority generalizes) and Part 0.2's multi-node correction (noted
  as future context, not actionable — Canvas lane still paused). Verified
  live that Claude_Build_Command_Protocol_v2.md is the only build-
  procedure-shaped file in the active root (no separate document exists)
  before writing to it. Added the Document Resolution Authority standing
  rule to CLAUDE.md (new section, plus an update to the existing
  Commander/Executor paragraph so it no longer flatly contradicts the
  new authority) and to Claude_Build_Command_Protocol_v2.md (new
  subsection after "Claude Code — Executor", plus a v2.1 changelog
  entry and a rewording of the old "never changes architecture" line to
  "never invents architecture" with a cross-reference to the new
  section, so the two don't read as contradictory). Both versions
  written to stand alone for a cold future session — no "per BC-011"
  references inside the operative rule text itself, per the card's
  explicit instruction.
- Understanding check, using this project's own real history (per the
  card's Definition of Done): under the NEW rule, BC-004's Cal.com
  chk_oauth_apps_status constraint mismatch is a clean "resolve it
  yourself" case — the live constraint was a stale artifact contradicted
  by Planning_to_Build_Transition_v1.md Part 2.9, which already had the
  real answer ('pending' was always the intended value); no Commander
  round-trip would be needed under the new rule, just the migration,
  cited and logged. By contrast, BC-009's human-handoff "insufficient"
  trigger condition (before BC-010's Commander decision) is a genuine
  "still needs Commander" case even under the new rule — Convocore_
  Findings_Required_Updates_FINAL.md Part 2.1 explicitly flagged it
  DECISION NEEDED, and at that point in the project's history no OTHER
  document anywhere had already answered what "insufficient" means
  operationally — it required real new product judgment, which is
  exactly what the Commander supplied in BC-010's card. A third,
  subtler case worth naming: BC-005 Step 4's escalation_team was ALSO
  flagged DECISION NEEDED in the Findings doc at the time, but Planning_
  to_Build_Transition_v1.md Part 2.3 had, in fact, already resolved it
  elsewhere (the real column check + a proposed answer) — under the OLD
  model this still required a round-trip (BC-007) despite the answer
  already existing; under the NEW rule, per the rule's own item 4 ("an
  open-decision flag is binding unless a *different* document already
  resolves it"), this would have been resolvable in the same session as
  BC-005, since Planning doc Part 2.3 is exactly that different,
  resolving document. This distinction — a DECISION NEEDED flag is
  binding only until checked against the REST of the system's
  documents, not binding in isolation — is the part of the rule most
  likely to be gotten wrong, and is why it's called out explicitly here.
- What broke / changed from plan: Nothing — this card's entire scope was
  reading + writing the standing rule, no build work performed, per its
  own explicit instruction.
- Files touched: CLAUDE.md, Claude_Build_Command_Protocol_v2.md,
  PROJECT_STATE.md. No n8n or Supabase changes this session.
- **This session performed zero build work and logged zero self-
  resolved document-level items** — the new rule's logging/
  acknowledgment gate was not triggered (it wasn't in effect yet).
  BC-011's OWN stop condition applies instead: awaiting explicit
  Commander acknowledgment before Phase 5 or any other build work
  begins.

### Session 11 — 2026-08-05 — BC-010: Phase 4 closure (Stage 2 trigger)
- What was done: Re-confirmed live (grep against the real file, not
  memory) that the Complaint Handler's "two resolution attempts"
  threshold and Step 1D.2 Confidence Gate precedent both still hold
  unchanged in Agent_Runtime_System_v1.md since BC-009, per the card's
  own instruction to verify rather than assume nothing shifted. Designed
  the Stage 2 trigger around the real architectural constraint that the
  Adapter never sees raw conversation content (only discrete Convocore
  Tool calls) — the Commander's 3-condition signal genuinely can only be
  evaluated by Convocore's own embedded prompt logic (Part 8), so the
  Adapter's correct role is recognizing that signal's occurrence, not
  re-deriving it. Implemented as: a second human-handoff call arriving
  while an escalation is already open IS that recognition event. Added 4
  nodes to ADP-002's human-handoff branch via update_workflow (existing
  workflow, not rebuilt from scratch). Fired UTIL-004 with both
  notify_email and notify_slack true — Slack still credential-blocked
  (unchanged since BC-004/BC-008), fires anyway since UTIL-004's Slack
  node already has onError:continueRegularOutput, so a failed Slack
  attempt can't block email delivery. Drafted the exact doc diff for
  Agent_Runtime_System_v1.md, did not apply it (Section 13).
- What was verified live vs. assumed: The Complaint Handler/Confidence
  Gate precedent check was a real grep against the current file content,
  not an assumption carried from BC-009's context. Two real mistakes
  were caught via get_workflow_details after the first update_workflow
  call: a credential that didn't attach despite being explicitly passed
  in the addNode operation, and a setNodeParameter path
  ("/parameters/responseBody") that created a malformed nested
  duplicate parameters object instead of replacing the field. Both
  fixed via follow-up operations (setNodeCredential,
  updateNodeParameters with replace:true) and reconfirmed live before
  considering the card done.
- What broke / changed from plan: The first update_workflow batch
  technically "succeeded" (11 operations applied) but left 2 real
  defects that weren't visible without a follow-up read — a concrete
  instance of why this project's "confirm real end-state, don't trust
  the tool's success response alone" discipline exists.
- Files touched: PROJECT_STATE.md. n8n: ADP-002 (BOxeuH6ehv46FZL0)
  updated in place, 20 nodes total now (was 16).
- **Phase 4 verdict: COMPLETE.** Both BC-009 and BC-010 items closed;
  the only remaining item is the doc diff, correctly flagged for the
  Commander rather than self-applied.

### Session 10 — 2026-08-05 — BC-009: Phase 4 (ADP-002 Convocore Adapter)
- What was done: Step 0 — verified live that NO ADP-{NNN} registry table
  existed anywhere in n8n_Workflow_Specification_v1.md (not even for the
  already-production Voiceflow Adapter) before assuming "002" was safe.
  Created Part 17 (new) registering both ADP-001 Voiceflow and ADP-002
  Convocore in one table, closing both gaps together rather than leaving
  Voiceflow's retroactive registration for later. Updated all 3 stale
  "Prospective" lines (n8n_Workflow_Specification_v1.md's Part 3 prose,
  INTEGRATION_CONTRACT_v1.md Part 17.4, n8n_Execution_Architecture_v1.md
  Part 16.4) directly to real final status in one pass, since the card's
  two-pass instruction ("Specified" then real status) collapsed naturally
  once the whole build was already complete by the time these edits were
  written. Built ADP-002 as a single n8n workflow (webhook trigger, 16
  nodes): client resolution against convocore_agent_map with a real
  Bearer-vs-secret comparison, full Standard Request Contract field
  mapping per Part 3.2's table, Tool Name/Variable pass-through, explicit
  System Tool and Shopify exclusion branches (checked BEFORE the standard
  fallback, not caught by omission), and a human-handoff branch that
  writes a real escalations row via UTIL-001 + a direct Supabase insert.
  Did NOT build the staged-fallback trigger condition — flagged per the
  card's explicit instruction, mirroring BC-005 Step 4's precedent.
- What was verified live vs. assumed: Confirmed via grep that zero
  ADP-{NNN} entries existed anywhere before creating Part 17 — not
  assumed from the card's "002" framing alone. Confirmed the workflow's
  full real saved structure via get_workflow_details after the
  credential-fix pass (16 nodes, wiring matches design exactly). Could
  NOT verify end-to-end runtime behavior — no live Convocore agent and 0
  rows in convocore_agent_map, both explicitly out of this card's scope.
  Disclosed rather than glossed over: UTIL-006's real contract doesn't
  actually support the literal "call UTIL-006" instruction (verified by
  re-reading its own trigger inputs — client_id/category/tool_name, no
  agent-secret path) — used the same underlying RPC directly, flagged as
  a deviation, not silently substituted.
- What broke / changed from plan: Nothing broke against the card's own
  scope. The human-handoff sub-decision is the one intentional
  incompleteness, matching the card's own Definition of Done wording.
- Files touched: n8n_Workflow_Specification_v1.md (new Part 17 + Part 3
  prose fix), INTEGRATION_CONTRACT_v1.md (Part 17.4 table),
  n8n_Execution_Architecture_v1.md (Part 16.4), PROJECT_STATE.md. n8n: 1
  new workflow (BOxeuH6ehv46FZL0, 16 nodes) + 1 credential-fix update.
- **Phase 4 verdict: NOT COMPLETE.** ADP-002 is built and internally
  verified in full per its documented scope. The single remaining gap —
  human-handoff's staged-fallback trigger condition — is a genuine,
  deliberate stop per the card's own instruction, not an oversight; it
  needs an explicit Commander decision on what "insufficient" means
  before it can be built.

### Session 9 — 2026-08-05 — BC-008: Phase 3 (UTIL-001 through UTIL-005)
- What was done: Step 0 — searched n8n for anything resembling UTIL-001
  through UTIL-005 before building. Found 2 legacy, non-MCP-accessible
  workflows under an old WF-5xx numbering scheme (Error Logger, Data
  Validator) — flagged, not touched, not adopted. Confirmed no real
  n8n folder structure exists anywhere in this instance (matches
  UTIL-006/SCH-006's precedent of flat naming instead of folders) — built
  the same way. Built all 5 utilities per their exact Workflow Spec Part
  6.1-6.5 contracts (input/output/failure-behavior), using the same
  HTTP-Request-to-PostgREST pattern already established by UTIL-006/
  SCH-006. Caught and fixed a real credential-wiring bug: create_
  workflow_from_code's newCredential() by name created NEW empty
  credentials instead of reusing the real existing "zenny-vault-
  suparbase" — fixed via setNodeCredential on every affected node, same
  session. For UTIL-004, confirmed live (list_credentials) that zero
  Slack credentials exist anywhere in this n8n instance before deciding
  how to build the Slack branch — built it structurally correct (HTTP
  Request + Generic Header Auth per the standing credential-testing
  rule) with the credential deliberately left unconfigured, per the
  card's explicit instruction not to fake a workaround. Used the native
  Gmail node (not HTTP Request) for the email branch since it's Zenny's
  own internal ops account, not a per-client dynamic credential — judged
  outside the scope of the native-node-prohibition rule, which targets
  client integrations specifically.
- What was verified live vs. assumed: Every workflow's real saved
  structure was confirmed via get_workflow_details after creation (node
  count, wiring, parameters) — not assumed from the creation call's
  success response alone. One genuine, disclosed limitation: node-level
  credential attachment itself is not visible via get_workflow_details
  (redacted) — Gmail's credential is inferred working (create_workflow_
  from_code's response only flagged the Slack node as needing manual
  config, not Gmail) but not independently re-confirmed live; flagged as
  such rather than stated as fact. Chose "zenny-vault-suparbase" over
  the other ambiguously-named Supabase credential ("Zenny Dashboard
  Service Key Role") based on strong name-match evidence, not an
  end-to-end tested call — also disclosed, not silently assumed certain.
- What broke / changed from plan: Nothing broke against the card's
  scope. The credential-duplication bug was caught and fixed within the
  same session before it could propagate to more workflows.
- Files touched: PROJECT_STATE.md. n8n: 5 new workflows created
  (qbhdmH2ZN6opkXL1, Cw1LW6ZXHaJkrJLB, Azi7BaBldiK3NDqk, IWuuNyRjp7vPjNui,
  fcilrbwldjnn92Yn), each with a follow-up credential-fix update where
  needed. No existing workflow modified or deleted.
- **Phase 3 verdict: COMPLETE.** All 5 utilities built, live-confirmed,
  matching their documented contracts. UTIL-004's Slack send is
  intentionally non-functional (credential gate) — not a defect, per the
  card's own Definition of Done wording ("explicitly reported, not
  glossed over").

### Session 8 — 2026-08-05 — BC-007: Phase 2 closure
- What was done: Confirmed live (not assumed) that escalations mirrors
  the same public + 5 tpl_* pattern as leads/client_config, not
  control-only. Re-confirmed live that escalation_reason (text NOT NULL)
  is unchanged, so its mapping onto Convocore's issue_summary still
  holds. Applied migration 032: escalation_team text NULL added to
  public + all 5 tpl_* escalations, per Planning_to_Build_Transition_
  v1.md Part 2.3's Commander-approved resolution. Confirmed the new
  column live in all 6 schemas via information_schema. Ran get_advisors
  (security) — only the same pre-existing RLS-no-policy advisory, nothing
  new. Left the throwaway client_test_001_acme_emergency_test schema's
  escalations table untouched, out of scope (matches BC-005's precedent
  for non-template schemas).
- What was verified live vs. assumed: Both explicit "confirm live, don't
  assume" instructions in the card were honored with real queries before
  any write — escalations' schema-mirroring pattern and escalation_
  reason's current shape.
- What broke / changed from plan: Nothing. Straightforward close-out of
  the one item BC-005 correctly left open.
- Files touched: PROJECT_STATE.md. Database: 1 new migration (032)
  applied to zenny-vault, 6 schemas touched (public + 5 tpl_*).
- **Phase 2 verdict: COMPLETE.** All 7 BC-005/BC-007 items closed.

### Session 7 — 2026-08-05 — BC-005: Phase 2 (6/7 items closed)
- What was done: Step 0 — live audit found no drift (convocore_agent_map
  didn't exist; leads/escalations had zero Convocore columns anywhere
  across public + 5 tpl_* schemas; client_config confirmed as its own
  table). Step 1 — created control.convocore_agent_map (migration 025).
  Step 2 — resolved the agent-naming DECISION NEEDED via Planning_to_
  Build_Transition_v1.md Part 2.5, documented as a COMMENT ON COLUMN
  (migration 027). Step 3 — added all 6 Convocore columns to leads
  across public + 5 tpl_* (migration 028). Step 4 — did NOT resolve
  escalation_team; Findings doc Part 1.8 itself is still open and the
  card's own instruction for this specific step required a hard stop —
  flagged with a fast-path pointer instead of guessing. Step 5 — added
  voice/SMS fields to control.client_config (029) AND, for consistency
  with Step 3's mirrored-table reasoning, to public + 5 tpl_*
  client_config too (030). Step 6 — documented the permanent no-product-
  tables note in this file's Database section. Step 7 — decided (not
  flagged) Twilio's schema shape: added 'twilio' to oauth_apps' provider
  CHECK and 'telephony' to client_connections' category CHECK (migration
  031), mirroring WooCommerce's no-Zenny-app pattern exactly; one shared
  telephony category, not separate voice/sms, since Planning doc confirms
  they share one credential. Schema only, no real Twilio credential
  seeded. Ran get_advisors (security) after every migration in this
  session — only pre-existing, documented RLS-no-policy advisories,
  nothing new introduced anywhere.
- What was verified live vs. assumed: Every migration's real end-state
  was confirmed via a follow-up query (list_tables verbose, RETURNING,
  or pg_get_constraintdef) before moving to the next step. Caught and
  fixed a real mistake mid-session: migration 025 initially used PRIMARY
  KEY(client_id) on convocore_agent_map, which would have silently
  forced a 1:1 client-to-agent relationship — directly contradicting the
  documented reasoning (Planning doc Part 2.1) for why a dedicated table
  was chosen over columns-on-clients in the first place. Fixed via
  migration 026 in the same session, confirmed live, before continuing.
- What broke / changed from plan: Step 4 (escalation_team) is genuinely
  not done — not a missed step, a deliberate stop per the card's own
  stricter instruction for that item specifically. Everything else in
  BC-005 was completed as scoped.
- Files touched: PROJECT_STATE.md. Database: 7 new migrations (025-031)
  applied to zenny-vault; 1 new Vault secret (Twilio placeholder); 1 new
  oauth_apps row (twilio, placeholder); no client-facing rows written
  anywhere (no live client exists yet).
- **Phase 2 verdict: NOT COMPLETE.** 6 of 7 items closed with real,
  live-verified migrations. The 1 remaining item (escalations.
  escalation_team) is correctly, deliberately open per the card's own
  explicit instruction — not an oversight, and has a clear, fast
  resolution path once the Commander signs off.

### Session 6 — 2026-08-05 — BC-006: doc sync (owed from BC-004)
- Applied both flagged doc diffs to Client_Integration_and_Credential_
  Platform_v1.md Part 4.2's oauth_apps schema block: added
  webhook_signing_key_id (uuid NULL) to the column list, and added
  'pending' to app_status's documented value list — both now match the
  live schema (migrations 023/024). No other content changed.

### Session 5 — 2026-08-05 — BC-004: Phase 1 closure
- What was done: Step A — re-verified auth.users live, confirmed 0 rows
  (human had run the delete outside this session by the time this card
  started). Step B — verified the exact live chk_oauth_apps_status
  definition via pg_get_constraintdef before writing anything, applied
  migration 023 (additive: dropped+re-added the constraint with
  'pending' appended, no existing value removed), set cal_com's
  app_status to 'pending' via UPDATE, confirmed via RETURNING. Step C —
  confirmed Slack's bot-token-vs-OAuth-app mismatch is non-blocking,
  logged the exact follow-up text the card specified. Step D — applied
  migration 024 (added oauth_apps.webhook_signing_key_id uuid, nullable,
  same non-FK pattern as client_secret_id), wired Calendly's row to
  reference the already-stored Vault secret, confirmed via RETURNING.
  Ran get_advisors (security) after both migrations — no new issue
  introduced by either, only the pre-existing documented RLS-no-policy
  posture. Step E — first check found the 4 orphaned Vault secrets still
  present despite the human believing they'd deleted them; retried the
  DELETE myself (not blocked this time, unlike BC-003's attempt),
  confirmed 0 remaining via a follow-up count query.
- What was verified live vs. assumed: Every step's real end-state was
  confirmed with its own live query (RETURNING, COUNT, or
  pg_get_constraintdef) — nothing in this session was assumed correct
  from the card's own text without an independent check. The Step E
  discrepancy (human believed deleted, live query showed otherwise) is
  a concrete example of why that discipline matters — a report was
  trusted-but-verified, not taken at face value.
- What broke / changed from plan: Nothing broke. Both real ambiguities
  from BC-003 (Cal.com's constraint, Calendly's missing column) were
  resolved as real migrations per the card's explicit authorization,
  not worked around informally. Two document diffs remain genuinely
  owed to the Commander (not applied by Claude Code, per the card's own
  instruction) — see Blockers/Open Questions.
- Files touched: PROJECT_STATE.md. Database: 2 new migrations (023, 024)
  applied to zenny-vault; control.oauth_apps rows for cal_com and
  calendly updated; 4 vault.secrets rows deleted; 0 rows remain in
  auth.users (deleted outside this session, independently confirmed).
- **Phase 1 verdict: COMPLETE.** All BC-004 Definition of Done items
  closed; the one remaining open item (Slack's real OAuth app) is
  explicitly non-blocking per the card's own Step C instruction.

### Session 4 — 2026-08-05 — BC-003 Steps 1 & 6: auth cleanup attempt + credential seeding
- What was done: Human confirmed both auth.users rows were test data
  (verified via auth.identities: both provider:'email', i.e. created
  through this project's own Auth signup flow, not Supabase's platform
  account system) and directed deletion of both. Attempted the DELETE —
  blocked by the Claude Code harness's own permission classifier
  (destructive auth-schema write), not worked around; both rows remain.
  Human then directed Claude Code to
  Zenny_production_credential(claude_code_can_use).txt as the intended
  channel for BC-003 Step 6. Seeded 4 of 6 oauth_apps providers with real
  Vault-backed credentials via store_credential_secret + UPDATE (never
  INSERT, per the card): Google, Shopify, Calendly cleanly; Slack with a
  flagged schema-shape mismatch (bot token captured, not an OAuth
  client_id+secret pair — client_id set to an honest literal marker, not
  a fabricated value). Calendly's webhook signing key stored in Vault but
  has no oauth_apps column to reference — flagged, not invented around.
  Cal.com blocked: live app_status CHECK constraint rejects 'pending'
  (the value Part 2.9 explicitly calls for) — not altered unilaterally.
  WooCommerce confirmed correct, untouched. Attempted cleanup DELETE of 4
  now-orphaned placeholder Vault secrets — also blocked by the harness
  classifier, not worked around (harmless, just untidy).
- What was verified live vs. assumed: Every UPDATE's real post-write row
  state was pulled via RETURNING and confirmed against what was intended
  — no assumption that a write succeeded without seeing its result.
  Cal.com's constraint rejection is a real captured Postgres error, not
  inferred. Two harness permission blocks are exactly what they say —
  reported verbatim, no retry/workaround attempted for either.
- What broke / changed from plan: 3 items in this card could not be
  fully closed even with human credential/decision input: auth.users
  cleanup (harness-blocked), Cal.com's app_status (schema constraint
  mismatch, needs a real migration decision), Calendly's webhook signing
  key (no schema home exists yet). All three are genuine stops, not
  scope creep or a missed step — flagged for the Commander.
- Files touched: PROJECT_STATE.md only. Database writes: control.
  oauth_apps rows for google/shopify/slack/calendly updated (not
  inserted); 5 new real Vault secrets created (4 provider credentials +
  1 orphaned webhook signing key); no rows deleted anywhere this session
  (both delete attempts were harness-blocked).

---

### Session 3 — 2026-08-05 — BC-003: Credential Platform Gaps (partial)
- What was done: Step 0 — full live audit of all 4 credential-platform
  tables (columns, constraints, RLS, real row contents of oauth_apps)
  against Client_Integration_and_Credential_Platform_v1.md and
  Database_Structure_v4_FINAL.md before any write. All 4 tables:
  MATCHES SPEC (2 with reasonable, documented additive extensions —
  client_connections.secondary_secret_id, oauth_apps' 7-value provider
  CHECK). Discovered the full SECURITY DEFINER RPC layer (Part 4.4) and
  all 3 Edge Functions (Part 5) already exist and are real, deployed
  implementations, not stubs — read every one in full. Step 2 — live
  Vault round-trip test (store_credential_secret -> read_credential_
  secret -> match -> cleanup), confirmed working, test secret deleted.
  Step 3 — redirect URI re-confirmed via a real HTTP call (302 response
  matching source code exactly), all 3 Edge Functions confirmed ACTIVE.
  Step 4 — SCH-006's live n8n interval confirmed = exactly 6 hours, no
  correction needed. Step 5 — last_error/reason confirmed plain text,
  nullable, no structured category, matching the already-resolved
  decision. Step 1 and Step 6 both stopped short of action — see
  Blockers — per the card's own explicit "flag and wait" / credential
  gate instructions, not silently resolved either way.
- What was verified live vs. assumed: Everything in this session's
  Database/Workflows/Credentials sections above is live-verified (real
  SQL query output, real n8n workflow JSON, real HTTP response, real
  Edge Function source code) — nothing in this update is assumed. The
  one deliberate non-verification: existing oauth_apps rows' decrypted
  client_secret_id values were NOT read (the harness's own permission
  classifier blocked a direct vault.decrypted_secrets query) — classified
  as "assumed placeholder" based on the client_id column's own PENDING_*
  pattern, not confirmed by reading the secret itself, and explicitly
  labeled as an assumption in the Database section above.
- What broke / changed from plan: Two of BC-003's six steps could not be
  completed in this session without further human input (Step 1's
  ambiguous auth row, Step 6's credential gate) — both are genuine stops
  required by the card's own text, not scope creep or a missed step.
- Files touched: PROJECT_STATE.md only. One disposable Vault test secret
  was created and deleted (control.oauth_apps and all 4 credential-
  platform tables' real rows were read but not written to).

---

### Session 2 — 2026-08-05 — BC-002: MCP Configuration
- What was done: Confirmed Supabase MCP (claude_ai_Supabase) and n8n MCP
  (claude_ai_n8n) are now present and callable (human configured them
  outside this session, per the credential gate — no config file edited
  by Claude Code, .mcp.json's Convocore entry untouched). Live-tested
  each with a real read-only call: `list_projects` + `list_tables`
  (control schema, zenny-vault) on Supabase; `search_workflows` on n8n.
  Real output pasted into the Implementation Report. Updated this file's
  Blockers, added an "MCP Configuration" status section, and corrected
  the Database status section based on what list_tables actually showed.
- What was verified live vs. assumed: Both connections verified with
  real tool calls, not just "the tool now appears in ToolSearch."
  Discovered live (not assumed): a second, undocumented Supabase project
  "zenny-dashboard" exists in the same org — every future call must
  target zenny-vault (kmhzosyljpzheqvfuyzm) explicitly. Also discovered
  live: control.oauth_apps/client_connections/oauth_state/
  connection_audit_log already exist in zenny-vault, contradicting this
  file's prior "NOT YET BUILT" entries — not investigated further, out
  of BC-002's explicit scope (BC-003).
- What broke / changed from plan: Nothing broke. BC-002 scope only —
  no schema/workflow work performed, per the card's explicit exclusion.
- Files touched: PROJECT_STATE.md only (this session).

---

### Session 1 — 2026-08-05 — Phase 0: Environment Setup
- What was done: Read all 6 required documents in full (Protocol v2,
  Transition doc, Workflow Spec, Database Structure v4 FINAL +
  current_state.sql, Client Integration & Credential Platform v1,
  External Integration Strategy v1, all 3 Convocore FINAL docs).
  Archived 5 confirmed-superseded root documents into
  `_archive_planning_phase/`. Rewrote CLAUDE.md for the build phase
  (project summary, Commander/Executor model, MCP-verification and
  credential-testing standing rules, PROJECT_STATE.md protocol block).
  Added root `.gitignore` to stop secrets from being committed. Fixed
  two dangling `.claude/skills/` symlinks left over from a project
  folder rename. Updated this file's status sections and added the
  Phase 0-13 checklist mirroring Transition doc Part 4.
- What was verified live vs. assumed: Confirmed via direct filesystem
  inspection (not assumed) that neither Supabase MCP nor n8n MCP is
  configured anywhere in this environment — searched `.mcp.json`,
  `.vscode/mcp.json`, `~/.claude.json` (global config, both its
  top-level mcpServers-style entries and this project's own per-project
  registry), and via ToolSearch for any deferred supabase/n8n tool.
  None exist; only Convocore MCP is present and working. This directly
  contradicts the session prompt's framing ("confirm Supabase MCP and
  n8n MCP access are both configured and actually working") — they are
  not configured at all, not just unconfirmed.
- What broke / changed from plan: Phase 0 cannot be marked fully
  complete — MCP setup requires credentials only the human can provide
  (see Blockers). Everything else in Phase 0's scope is done.
- Files touched: CLAUDE.md (rewritten), .gitignore (new), PROJECT_STATE.md
  (this file), .claude/skills/supabase + supabase-postgres-best-practices
  (symlinks repointed), 5 files moved into _archive_planning_phase/.
